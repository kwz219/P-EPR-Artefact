## The P-EPR Framework
![PEPR_architecture](./Figs/P-EPR-Framework.PNG)

We propose a Preference-based Ensemble Program Repair framework (**P-EPR**),
which aims to efficiently assemble existing diverse APR tools. The term `preference' refers to the features of bugs that can be more readily addressed by a given tool than others, i.e., the tool has a higher probability to generate a correct fix for that kind of bug. 
For a given bug, **P-EPR** ranks available tools by quantifying each tool's preference score based on computed mappings of tools' preferences.

## Scoring Algorithm of P-EPR

This pseudocode describes how P-EPR computes preference scores of available APR tools
(corresponding to section 3.3 of the paper).
