## The P-EPR Framework
![PEPR_architecture](./Figs/P-EPR-Framework.PNG)

We propose a Preference-based Ensemble Program Repair framework (**P-EPR**),
which aims to efficiently assemble existing diverse APR tools. The term `preference' refers to the features of bugs that can be more readily addressed by a given tool than others, i.e., the tool has a higher probability to generate a correct fix for that kind of bug. 
For a given bug, **P-EPR** ranks available tools by quantifying each tool's preference score based on computed mappings of tools' preferences.


## Instructions for using P-EPR
Requirements: Java version 11.0.13 (for executing Spoon)

### Explanations of parameters
>-mode: initialize or inference. Under the initialize mode, P-EPR initialize/update configured/new tools with given repair history; Under the inference mode, P-RPR receives a buggy class file, as well as the fault_location and test error type (if available) and predicts scores of each configured tools.

>-tool_config_dir: where does P-EPR should load the configurations of tools (both for initialize or inference)

>-save_dir: where to store the tool configurations after initialization

>-repair_history_info: For initialization, a json file that contains the meta information of tools' repair history, including tool which requires initialization or update and a list of repair samples. Each repair sample should provide the fault file location, fault line location, and test_error_type.

>-input_file: For inference, where the buggy file is

>-fault_line_ids: For inference, the faulty line locations of the buggy file. Egs of Line or Lines: (1) for single-line fault: 175 (2) for multi_line faults: 175,176,178 or 175-176,178

>-test_error_type:  For inference, the test error type of the fault. If this information is not available, set it to junit.framework.AssertionFailedError

>-result_file: For inference, the position to store the predicts results. It is a json file that records the preference scores of each configured tools in P-EPR 

### Initialize 
> java -jar ./ToolRanker.jar -mode initialize -save_dir ./P-EPR-egs/Initialize/tool_configs_initialized -tool_config_dir ./P-EPR-egs/Initialize/tool_configs_original -repair_history_info ./P-EPR-egs/Initialize/DatasetInfo.json -log_dir ./P-EPR-egs/Initialize
### Inference 
> java -jar ./ToolRanker.jar -mode inference -tool_config_dir ./P-EPR-egs/Inference/D4j_trained_tools -result_file ./result.json -input_file ./P-EPR-egs/infer_rg.java -faulty_line_ids 175 -test_err_type junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
### Integrating New Tools
write a json file as the following format:

>{
	"tool_name":"tool_name",
	"explicit_preferences":[
		"Cast",
		"Operator",
		"Super",
		"Array",
		"Invocation",
		"Literal",
		"DataType",
		"Return"
	],
	"total_fixed_count":1,
	"total_failed_count":0,
	"history_preferences":{
		"type_history":{
		},
		"test_history":{
		}
	}
}

"explicit_preferences" refs to the repair patterns of the tool, we have summarized patterns of 21 tools, please ref to ./P-EPR-egs/Inference/D4j_trained_tools.
If your new tool has implemented some of our patterns, just provide the pattern keywords.
And the mapping of keywords and repair patterns are as following:

| Keyword    | Repair Pattern     | Implemented Systems    |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| "Cast" | P1 Insert Cast Checker | Heuristic-based: HDRepair, SimFix, CapGen; Template-based: AVATAR, Genesis, kPAR, SketchFix, TBar, SOFix |
| "Operator" |P11 Mutate Operators | Heuristic-based: CapGen, HDRepair, ssFix, SimFix; Template-based: AVATAR, Elixir, FixMiner, kPAR, jMutRepair, SOFix. SketchFix, TBar;Constraint-based: S3|
| "Super" | P5 Mutate Class Instance Creation | Template-based: AVATAR, TBar |
| "Array" | P3 Insert Range Checker | Template-based: AVATAR, Elixir, kPAR, SketchFix, TBar, SOFix |
| "Invocation" | P10 Mutate Method Invocation Expression | Heuristic-based: CapGen, HDRepair, SOFix, ssFix, SimFix; Template-based: Elixir, FixMiner, kPAR, SketchFix, SOFix, TBar |
| "Literal" | P9 Mutate Literal Expression | Heuristic-based: CapGen, HDRepair, SimFix, ssFix; Template-based: FixMiner, TBar ; Constraint-based: S3 |
| "DataType" | P7 Mutate Data Type | Heuristic-based: CapGen, SimFix; Tempate-based: AVATAR,SOFix, Elixir, FixMiner, kPAR, TBar |
| "Return" | P12 Mutate Return Statement | Template-based: Elixir, SketchFix, TBar; Heuristic-based: HDRepair |
| "Division" | P8 Mutate Integer Division Operation |Template-based: TBar|
| "Exception" | P4 Throw Exception|Constraint-based: ACS |
| "None" | no preferred patterns | Tools that have no patterns, e.g., most of the learning-based systems |

### Integrating New Repair Patterns
Modify the file BugFeaturer/src/main/java/Preference/TypePreference.java

Easily add a new judgement of your new patterns through defining four objects:
>element_check: need to check the type of the buggy statement

>check_type: what the elements should contain

>child_check: need to check all the child nodes of the buggy statement
 
>child_check_types: what the childs of the buggy statment should contain

For example, the pattern "Array" should check whether the child nodes of the buggy statement involves with ArrayWrite or ArrayRead
